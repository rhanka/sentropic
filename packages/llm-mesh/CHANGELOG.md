# Changelog

## 0.22.0

- Add the pure route quote API: `quoteRoute`, `RouteQuoteError`,
  `MAX_ROUTE_QUOTE_CANDIDATES` and the `RouteUsageCeiling`, `RouteQuoteInput`,
  `QuotedRouteCandidate`, `RouteQuote` contract types. A quote is synchronous,
  performs no I/O or clock read and never calls the account directory.
- `RoutePlanner` gains optional `quote(input)`; `InMemoryRoutePlanner` delegates
  with its council and policy profiles.
- `RoutePlanInput` gains optional `quote`; `plan()` keeps only quoted targets,
  caps attempts at the quoted maximum and throws `RoutePlanError` code
  `quote-mismatch` when the quote does not match.
- Additive 0.x minor: no provider wire change.
